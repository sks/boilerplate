# Creating Dual-Stack and IPv6-only subnets

This example shows how you can create dual-stack and IPv6-only subnets in your Amazon VPC. This example creates the following:

* VPC with IPv4 CIDR block and Amazon-generated IPv6 CIDR block.
* Internet gateway and Egress-only Internet gateway.
* 4 subnet types:
  * Public subnet (dual-stack) with NAT gateways in all the Availability Zones used.
  * IPv4-only private subnet, with default routes (0.0.0.0/0) via the NAT gateways.
  * Dual-stack private subnet, with IPv4 default route (0.0.0.0/0) via the NAT gateways and IPv6 default route (::/0) via the Egress-only Internet gateway.
  * IPv6-only private subnet, with IPv6 default route (::/0) via the Egress-only Internet gateway.
